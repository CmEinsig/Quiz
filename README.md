# Quiz
Javascript quiz

## Description
My motivation for this project was to test my new skills in JavaScript with timers. I built this project to create a quiz game using JavaScript. This solved the problem of creating a project to showcase putting CSS, HTML, and JavaScript together. Along the way, I learned that there are a lot of functions that go into creating a simple web game.
